TIRE DATASETS:

- This folder contains the tire test data collected during the 'round 5' (2012) by the TTC.
- The homework for the 2020/2021 EIT course was prepared with the dataset named B1464run30.mat, which refers to 
	the identification of the pure and combined longitudinal force with the tire compound Hoosier 18x6-10.
- The dataset named B1464run23.mat contains data for the identification of the pure and combined lateral force
	with the same tire compound Hoosier 18x6-10. 
- The folder TTC_full_dataset contains the full dataset for the test 'round 5' (which the datasets B1464run30.mat and
	B1464run23.mat belong to).
- Use the files TTC_full_dataset/round-05_Fz0_200/analysis_pure_later_slip.m, analysis_pure_later_slip_Mz.m,
	analysis_long_combined_slip.m, analysis_later_combined_slip.m for the analysis and identification  
	of the pure and combined lateral and longitudinal tire forces (using the datasets B1464run30.mat and B1464run23.mat).	
- Refer to the file TTC_full_dataset/round-05_Fz0_200/FromCalspan/1464 Summary Tables.xls for a complete summary of all 
	the tests carried out in this round 5 (other tire compounds were used as well).
